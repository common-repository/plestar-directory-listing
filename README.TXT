= Will Plestar Directory Listing work with my theme? =
Plestar Directory Listing will work with any well-written, WP 4.x compliant theme.

= Is Plestar Directory Listing compatible with WordPress Multisite (WPMU)? =
Yes it is. However, you cannot "network-activate" the plugin (as this will share the database). Activate it on only the subsites on which you need a directory.  This can be done under Plugins->Add New as the Administrator user.  Do not "network activate" PDL as the "super admin".
